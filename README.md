# Docuforge

Docuforge is a simple and efficient command-line tool (CLI) for automating documentation generation for any software project, regardless of the programming language or technology stack used.

## Features

- **Automatic Documentation Generation**: Docuforge allows developers to generate up-to-date and accessible documentation directly from the project's code structure.
- **Language Agnostic**: The tool is compatible with any programming language, ensuring flexibility and efficiency in any development environment.
- **File/Directory Exclusion**: Ability to configure the exclusion of certain files or directories from documentation generation.
- **CLI Execution**: Easy-to-use command-line interface for generating documentation with just a few commands.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Utilizes the OpenAI API to generate detailed and accurate descriptions of the project's files and directories.
- **Ollama Integration**: Supports integration with the Ollama API for generating documentation, providing an alternative to OpenAI.
- **Intelligent Regeneration**: Docuforge only regenerates documentation when changes are detected in the code, and it specifically targets only the modified files, saving time and resources.
- **Automatic Deletion of Documentation**: Docuforge automatically deletes documentation for files that have been removed from the project, keeping the documentation structure always updated according to the original project.

## Project Origin

This project is a fork of [codocx](https://github.com/jefferson-calmon/codocx), an original documentation generation tool. Docuforge was developed based on this project, expanding its functionalities and adapting it to meet specific needs.

## Setting Up Husky (Optional)

To automatically update documentation with each commit, you can set up Husky by following these steps:

1. Install Husky as a development dependency:

    ```bash
    yarn add -D husky
    ```

    Or using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev husky
    ```

2. Initialize Husky:

    ```bash
    npx husky-init
    ```

3. Create a script in your `package.json` called `gen-docs`:

    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "gen-docs": "docuforge"
      }
    }
    ```

4. Edit the `.husky/pre-commit` file to include the following:

    ```sh
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    . "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

    yarn gen-docs

    if [ -n "$(git status docs --porcelain)" ]; then
      git add docs
    fi
    ```

This setup will ensure that documentation is generated and updated automatically every time you make a commit.

## Overview

Documentation is essential, but often neglected. Docuforge solves this problem by allowing developers to generate up-to-date and accessible documentation with just a few commands. The tool is compatible with any programming language, ensuring flexibility and efficiency in any development environment.

## Running via CLI

The Docuforge CLI is designed to be extremely easy to use, allowing documentation generation directly from your project's code structure.

### How to Use the CLI

1. **Install the CLI globally:**

    ```bash
    npm install -g docuforge
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn global add docuforge
    ```

2. **Generate the documentation:**

    Navigate to your project directory and run:

    ```bash
    docuforge -p <DIR_PROJECT>
    ```

    You can replace `<DIR_PROJECT>` with the path to your project directory. If you don't provide a path, the CLI will use the current directory.

### Ignoring Files

To exclude certain files or directories from documentation generation, simply create a `.dcfignore` file and list the files and folders you want to ignore inside it. The tool will automatically ignore them. Additionally, there is a default list of ignored paths located in the `src/constants/index.ts` file.

### Using Ollama instead of OpenAI

To use the Ollama API for documentation generation instead of OpenAI, you can specify the `--ollama-mode` option when running the CLI. Additionally, you can set the Ollama base URL and model using the `--ollama-base-url` and `--ai-model` options, respectively. Hereâ€™s an example command:

```bash
docuforge --ollama-mode --ollama-base-url http://localhost:11434/api --ai-model llama3
```
By default, the Ollama API is used with the `llama3` model, and the `--ollama-base-url` option is set to http://localhost:11434/api. You can change the model by setting the `--ai-model` option to the desired model, and you can also specify a different base URL if needed.

## Requirements
